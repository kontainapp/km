name: Build L0 Base k8s Image on Azure

# FOR ACTUAL L0 IMAGE TO BE REPLACED, EITHER CHANGE L0_IMAGE_NAME BELOW OR
# OR RUN THE MAKE MANUALLY
# Manual run: make -C cloud/azure L0-image L0_VMIMAGE_NAME=L0BaseImage
# manual runs expect 'make -C cloud-azure login-cli' to be successful

# Reason: Azure currently does not allow to rename images, AND existing image is deleted before the
# packer can start creation of a new one. So if this build fails, ALL operations which need the L0 base
# image will fail. More that that, CI can race so the other ops would fail while this one is being
# successfully run
