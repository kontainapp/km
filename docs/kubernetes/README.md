# Kontain Integration Into Kubernetes

Kontain levereges the Runtime Class abstraction to allow containers controlled by the Kontain Monitor to exist
in Kubernetes clusters. Users define containers controlled by the Kontain Monitor by adding `runtimeClassName: kontain`
to otherwise ordinary YAML container specifications.

* See [Quick Start Guide](quickstart.md) for a demonstration of Kontain integrated with Kubernetes.
