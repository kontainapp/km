# m1 planning

this dir contains dev planning docs (architecture, design, project plans/work items - if any) for M1 planning.

M1 is the release we want to put together by Oct'20.

Requirements and experience are documented in [Kontain Platform Requirements](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1LPeGZEuRdgeGx-fvsZ3Gs8ltYp6xOB7MCk10zFwtpsE/edit#) . Note that we keep  code-related stuff in the code but make requirements/use cases/experience docs in google docs to make it easier to review by folks not on git
