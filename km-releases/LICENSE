Kontain Inc
Beta License

1. 	Agreement; Use of Beta Materials. Kontain Inc (“Kontain”) provides its  software, documentation and related materials (collectively “Beta Materials”), to you (“Customer”) for internal evaluation pursuant to this Beta License (the “Agreement”). By downloading or otherwise accessing or using the Beta Materials, Customer unconditionally accepts and agrees to all of the terms of this Agreement. By entering into this Agreement on behalf of a company or other legal entity, Customer represents that it has the authority to bind such entity to the terms of this Agreement, and, in such instance, the term “Customer” will refer to such entity. If Customer does not have such authority, or Customer does not agree to all of the terms of this Agreement, Customer may not use the Beta Materials. Subject to the terms of this Agreement, Kontain hereby grants to Customer a personal, non-sublicensable, non-transferable, and non-exclusive right and license to access and use the Beta Materials solely in accordance with the documentation or instructions supplied by Kontain solely for Customer’s internal evaluation purposes (and not for production purpose) during the term of this Agreement.  Kontain will at all times retain all right, title, and interest in and to the Beta Materials and all copies, improvements, enhancements and derivatives thereof. Customer agrees to use the Beta Materials only in the ordinary course of its internal evaluation, and Customer will not (and will not permit any third party to): (a) reproduce or modify the Beta Materials or any portion thereof; (b) rent, sell, lease, or otherwise transfer the Beta Materials or any part thereof or use the Beta Materials for the benefit of a third party; or (c) reverse assemble, reverse compile or reverse engineer the Beta Materials, or otherwise attempt to discover any Beta Materials source code or underlying Proprietary Information (as defined below). However, the foregoing is not intended to limit the terms of any applicable open source license that may apply to any portion or component of the Beta Materials (as described in the relevant documentation or in the Beta Materials directly). This Agreement does not entitle Customer to any support, upgrades, patches, enhancements, or fixes for the Beta Materials (collectively, “Support”), but any such Support that may be made available by Kontain (in its sole discretion) will become part of the Beta Materials and subject to this Agreement.

2. Confidentiality; Feedback. Customer acknowledges that, in the course of using the Beta Materials and performing its activities under this Agreement, it may obtain information relating to the Beta Materials and/or Kontain (“Proprietary Information”). Such Proprietary Information will belong solely to Kontain and includes, but is not limited to, the Beta Materials and the features, functionality and modes of operation thereof, this Agreement, trade secrets, know-how, inventions (whether or not patentable), techniques, processes, programs, ideas, algorithms, schematics, testing procedures, software design and architecture, computer code, internal documentation, design and function specifications, product requirements, problem reports, analysis and performance information, benchmarks, software documents, and other technical, business, product, marketing, and financial information, plans, and data. With respect to Proprietary Information: (a) Customer will not use (except as expressly authorized by this Agreement) or disclose Proprietary Information without the prior written consent of Kontain unless such Proprietary Information becomes readily publicly available without breach of this Agreement by Customer, its officers, directors, employees, or agents; (b) Customer agrees to take reasonable measures to maintain the Proprietary Information and Beta Materials in confidence; (c) Customer will disclose the Beta Materials and Proprietary Information only to those of its employees as are necessary for the use expressly and unambiguously licensed hereunder, and only after such employees have agreed in writing to be bound by terms no less restrictive than the provisions of this Agreement; and (d) Customer will not remove or export the Beta Materials or any Proprietary Information or any direct product thereof in violation of any applicable law or regulation. Further, if Customer provides or communicates to Kontain any feedback, discoveries, ideas, concepts, or suggestions relevant to the Beta Materials (or improvements, enhancements or modifications thereto) or Kontain’s business, technology or Proprietary Information (“Feedback”), Customer hereby grants Kontain, without charge, the fully paid-up, perpetual, irrevocable right and license to use, share, modify, commercialize, and otherwise fully exercise and exploit such Feedback and all related intellectual property or other rights (and to allow others to do so) in any way and for any purpose. These rights and the other obligations in this Section 2 survive termination of this agreement in perpetuity. 

3. Reports. From time to time upon Kontain’s request, Customer agrees to provide Kontain reports describing: (a) which portions of the Beta Materials have been used, (b) the nature of that use, (c) the extent or amount of use, (d) all errors or difficulties discovered, and (e) the characteristic conditions and symptoms of the errors and difficulties, in sufficient detail to allow Kontain to recreate the errors and difficulties itself.

4. Warranty Disclaimer. The parties acknowledge that the Beta Materials are provided “AS IS” without warranty of any kind. KONTAIN DISCLAIMS ALL WARRANTIES RELATING TO THE BETA MATERIALS, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, ANY WARRANTIES AGAINST INFRINGEMENT OF THIRD-PARTY RIGHTS, MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

5. Limitation of Remedies and Damages. KONTAIN WILL NOT BE RESPONSIBLE OR LIABLE WITH RESPECT TO ANY SUBJECT MATTER OF THIS AGREEMENT UNDER ANY CONTRACT, NEGLIGENCE, STRICT LIABILITY, OR OTHER LEGAL OR EQUITABLE THEORY (A) FOR LOSS OR INACCURACY OF DATA OR COST OF PROCUREMENT OF SUBSTITUTE PRODUCTS, SERVICES, OR TECHNOLOGY, (B) FOR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, LOSS OF REVENUES AND LOSS OF PROFITS, OR (C) FOR ANY AMOUNT IN THE AGGREGATE IN EXCESS OF THE FEES PAID BY CUSTOMER HEREUNDER, OR, IF GREATER, FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS ($500). KONTAIN WILL NOT BE RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY MATTER BEYOND ITS REASONABLE CONTROL.

6. Termination. This Agreement may be terminated by either party for any reason or no reason upon five (5) days’ written notice, or immediately upon notice of any breach by Customer of the provisions of this Agreement. Kontain may discontinue the provision of Beta Materials at any time in its sole discretion. Upon termination, all rights granted to Customer hereunder will automatically terminate and Customer will immediately cease its access and use of the Beta Materials and will return (or, at Kontain’s option destroy) any and all Beta Materials and Proprietary Information in Customer’s possession (including documents, notes, and other materials regarding the Beta Materials), but the terms of this Agreement will otherwise remain in effect.
 
7. Government Matters. If Customer is part of an agency, department, or other entity of the United States Government (“Government”), the use, duplication, reproduction, release, modification, disclosure or transfer of the Beta Materials is restricted in accordance with the Federal Acquisition Regulations as applied to civilian agencies and the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement as applied to military agencies. The Beta Materials are a “commercial item,” “commercial computer software” and “commercial computer software documentation.” In accordance with such provisions, any use of the Beta Materials by the Government will be governed solely by the terms of this Agreement.
 
8. General. Although fully assignable and transferable by Kontain, neither the rights nor the obligations arising under this Agreement are assignable or transferable by Customer, and any such attempted assignment or transfer will be void and without effect. This Agreement will be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of California without regard to the conflicts of laws provisions therein. In any action to enforce this Agreement the prevailing party will be entitled to costs and attorneys’ fees. In the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement will be held by a court or other tribunal of competent jurisdiction to be unenforceable, such provisions will be limited or eliminated to the minimum extent necessary so that this Agreement will otherwise remain in full force and effect and enforceable. This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement between the parties pertaining to the subject matter hereof, and any and all written or oral agreements previously existing between the parties are expressly cancelled. Any modifications of this Agreement must be in writing and signed by both parties. Customer acknowledges and agrees that due to the unique nature of Kontain’s Proprietary Information, there can be no adequate remedy at law for any breach of its obligations hereunder, that any such breach may allow Customer or third parties to unfairly compete with Kontain resulting in irreparable harm to Kontain, and therefore, that upon any such breach or threat thereof, Kontain will be entitled to injunctions and other appropriate equitable relief in addition to whatever remedies it may have at law.
