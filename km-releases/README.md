Scripts/examples/etc related to assembling and testing KM releases.

The Kontain User Guide, which provides information about using Kontain, can be found in Kontain's docs repo: https://github.com/kontainapp/km/blob/master/docs/user-guide.md.

Note: The engineering source for the User Guide is still available here: https://github.com/kontainapp/km-releases/blob/master/README.md. We do not maintain km-releases REPO anymore and it will eventually be put offline.
