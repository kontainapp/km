# Basic build for kontain payloads

# scan all these and  'make' stuff there

#  Note about ./busybox - we don't use busybox and there are build issues. Dropping for now.

# Filter out 'make test' requests' to assure that 'make test' only builds/tests KM. If payload needs to be tested, uses 'make test-all'
# Also, just 'make' will not cause building payloads , so it is reserved for building KM only. Use 'make all' or 'make build' to request payloads build
default test coverage:
	@echo "Info: ignoring target '$@' in payloads"

# use this target to force payloads build
