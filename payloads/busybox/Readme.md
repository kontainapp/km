# Busybox Kontain payload

NOTE: keeping for future use, not used and not maintained yet.

busybox.km is built here. Edit config.txt to change what goes into busybox, for now it's bare necessities.

DO NOT run make in payloads/busybox/busybox. Instead, ALWAYS build (build.sh or make) from payload/busybox
