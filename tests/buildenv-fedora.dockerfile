# Dockerfile for build image. There are three stages:
#
# buildenv-base - basic from OS image with the necessary packages installed
# build-libstdcpp - clone gcc source, then build and install libstdc++
# buildenv - based on buildenv-base and just copy the installed part from the previous
#
# Usage will be 'docker run <container> make TARGET=<target> - see ../../Makefile
