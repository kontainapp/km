# Dockerfile for buildenv image - these are thr base images for KM, tests and payload builds.

# There are three stages:
#
# alpine-lib-image - build image with alpine libs we need for runtime
# buildenv - fedora + DNF packages we need, and alpine packages for runtime
#
# Usage: 'docker run <container> make TARGET=<target>

# Form alpine-based container to extract alpine-libs from
# This is a temp stage, so we don't care about layers count.
