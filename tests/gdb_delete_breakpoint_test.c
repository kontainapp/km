 * Helper for gdb server entry race between a breakpoint and a seg fault.
 * The basic test is to have one thread hit a breakpoint and then have another
 * thread cause a seg fault.  We arrange for the breapointing thread to stall
 * in km_gdb_notify_and_wait() to give another thread a chance to get the
 * seg fault.  The sigill should take priority over the preceeding breakpoint
 * and should be reported back to the gdb client.

/*
 * The test driver will start this program under gdb and then
 * the gdb client will be driven from cmd_for_gdb_breakpoint_delete_test.gdb
 * This program creates 2 threads that just loop calling functions that will
 * have a breakpoint set on them.
 * Both threads will keep hitting breakpoints while the main thread hits
 * 2 breakpoints repeatedly.
 * The breakpoint handler for main thread hit_breakpoint1() will delete the breakpoint
 * for hit_breakpoint_thread2() and the breakpoint handler for hit_breakpoint2()
 * will add the breakpoint for hit_breakpoint_t2().
 * The breakpoint handler for hit_breakpoint_t1 and hit_breakpoint_t2() will continue.
 * The goal is to delete the breakpoint at hit_breakpoint_t2() while a breakpoint for that location
 * is pending but not delivered to the gdb client yet.  When the breakpoint
 * is deleted its pending breakpoint should also be deleted.
 * We can grep for a km_trace() in the output from km noting that a triggered
 * breakpoint was deleted because it was pending and the breakpoint that
 * caused it was deleted.
