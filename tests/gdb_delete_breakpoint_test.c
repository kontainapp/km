 * Helper for gdb delete breakpoint test where one thread hits a breakpoint in a loop
 * and the main thread disables and enables the other thread's breakpoint.
 * The goal is to have the breakpoint disabled while the thread hits that
 * breakpoint.  This resuls in a situation where the breakpoint that disables
 * and the breakpoint that is disabled happen in that order and close enough
 * in time that we have a pending gdb event for a breakpoint that no longer
 * exists.  gdb should handle that.
 * This test program runs with the gdb script cmd_for_delete_breakpoint_test.gdb

/*
 * The bats test driver will start this program under gdb and then
 * the gdb client will be driven from cmd_for_delete_breakpoint_test.gdb
 * This program creates one thread that just loops hitting a breakpoint.
 * The main thread hits 2 breakpoints repeatedly.  One breakpoint disables
 * the other thread's breakpoint and the other breakpoint enables the
 * other thread's breakpoint.
 * The goal is to have the main thread's breakpoint disable happen just before
 * the second thread's breakpoint is hit.  This condition leads to a deleted
 * breakpoint happening just after a breakpoint is hit.
 * We use a pthread barrier to get the 2 threads approximately synchronized.
 * And then we use flags for each thread to signal to the other that they
 * are about to hit their respective breakpoints.  Each thread waits in a
 * spin loop for the other thread to be ready.  All of this just helps
 * increase the odds of the desired race happening.
 * We can grep for a __km_trace() in the output from km noting that a triggered
 * breakpoint was deleted because it was pending and the breakpoint that
 * caused it was deleted.
