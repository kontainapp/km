 * Helper for gdb server entry race between a breakpoint and a seg fault.
 * The basic test is to have one thread hit a breakpoint and then have another
 * thread cause a seg fault.  We arrange for the breapointing thread to stall
 * in km_gdb_notify_and_wait() to give another thread a chance to get the
 * seg fault.  The sigill should take priority over the preceeding breakpoint
 * and should be reported back to the gdb client.
