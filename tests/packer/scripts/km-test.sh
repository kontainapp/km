# Script to run km tests on a VM. Generally runs on a remote VM and is controlled by the env vars below
#
[ "$TRACE" ] && set -x


# 1. Check parameters and prep environment
# ========================================

# The following env is expected to be pre-set by the invoker and needed for code called from here:
echo IMAGE_VERSION=${IMAGE_VERSION?please set IMAGE_VERSION}   # image tag for pulling testenv or runenv
echo HYPERVISOR_DEVICE=${HYPERVISOR_DEVICE?please set HYPERVISOR_DEVICE} # /dev/kvm or /dev/kkm
echo SRC_BRANCH=${SRC_BRANCH?please set SRC_BRANCH} # source code to check out for make system
echo SP_TENANT=${SP_TENANT?please set SP\* env vars for az login}
echo LOCATION=${LOCATION?Please set LOCATION env var to KM source dir where the test needs to run}
# Useful debug info (sans secrets)
env # | grep -v SP_ | grep -v GITHUB_TOKEN

# we only need KKM repo and Make system so not pulling in all submodules
echo Cloning KM repo. branch: ${SRC_BRANCH}
git clone https://$GITHUB_TOKEN@github.com:/kontainapp/km -b ${SRC_BRANCH}
cd km
