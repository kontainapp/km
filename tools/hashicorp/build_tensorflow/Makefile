# Build our own custom built version of tensorflow.
# The code isn't changed, we just compile it with `-D_GTHREAD_USE_RECURSIVE_MUTEX_INIT_FUNC=1`
# to disable use of non-POSIX primitives that are not supported on musl.
#
# "make all" builds it locally, takes 2 - 3 hours depending on the machine.
# "make upload" puts the result in azue file share.
# "make download" brings the result from azure share to avoid long compile
